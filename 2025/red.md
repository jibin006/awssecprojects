# 🌩️ **Cloud Safehouse: AWS Security Made Simple**

## ✨ **What’s This About?**

This project builds a **super-secure AWS setup**—think of it as a digital safehouse. It starts with hands-on setup, then switches to **Terraform** for automation, uses **Prowler** to spot risks, and taps **AI** to suggest fixes. It’s secure, scalable, and beginner-friendly!

## 🖼️ **The Setup**

```
You --> [SSH] --> Bastion (Public Area)  
              |  
              | [SSH/HTTP]  
              v  
         Web Servers (Private Area)  
              |  
         NAT Gateway (Public Area)  
              |  
         Internet Gateway (Whole Setup)
```

### **Key Pieces**:
| Part              | Details                  | Job                             |
|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **VPC**           | 10.0.0.0/16             | The main space                 |
| **Public Areas**  | 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24| For Bastion & NAT             |
| **Private Areas** | 10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24| For hidden servers            |
| **Internet Gate** | -                       | Connects to the web            |
| **NAT Gate**      | -                       | Lets private areas reach out   |
| **Bastion**       | t2.micro                | Your secure entry point        |
| **Web Servers**   | t2.micro (nginx)        | Runs the app inside            |
| **IAM**           | -                       | Controls who gets in           |
| **Security Rules**| -                       | Locks down traffic             |

---

## 🎯 **Goals**

- ✅ Build a **safe AWS space**  
- ✅ Split **public** and **private** zones  
- ✅ Control traffic with **rules**  
- ✅ Use **IAM** to limit access  
- ✅ Check for risks with **Prowler**  
- ✅ Get **AI** to spot and fix issues  
- ✅ Automate it all with **Terraform**  

---

## 🛠 **How It’s Built**

### **Step 1: Manual Setup**
1. Make the **VPC and zones**  
2. Add **Internet and NAT Gates**  
3. Set up **traffic paths**  
4. Place the **Bastion** in public  
5. Put **servers** in private  
6. Add **security rules** and **IAM**  
7. Save logs in **S3**  

### **Step 2: Prowler Check**
- Run **Prowler** to find:  
  - Access issues  
  - Open spots  
  - Rule breaks (like CIS or GDPR)  
- Get a **risk report**  

### **Step 3: AI Help**
- Use **AI** to read Prowler’s report  
- Get:  
  - Top risks  
  - Easy fixes  
  - Risk levels (big to small)  

### **Step 4: Terraform Magic**
- Redo it all with **Terraform**:  
  - VPC, zones, gates, servers  
  - IAM, S3, and rules  
- Share the **code** and setup

## 🧰 **Tools**

| Tool            | Job                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **AWS IAM**     | Keeps access tight           |
| **Prowler**     | Spots security gaps          |
| **S3**          | Stores logs safely           |
| **Security Rules**| Controls who talks to who   |

## 🤖 **AI Boost**

After Prowler, **AI** steps in to:  
- Sum up the risks  
- List fixes in order  
- Suggest better setups  
- Make a simple report  

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

- Add **AWS Config** for rule checks  
- Use **GuardDuty** for threat alerts  
- Try **Security Hub** for a big picture  
- Swap SSH for **SSM** (no keys!)  
- Automate more with **CI/CD**  
- Protect web apps with **WAF**  
- Watch logs with **CloudWatch**  

---

## 📖 **What I Learned**

- How to split and secure a **cloud space**  
- Locking things down with **IAM** and **rules**  
- Automating with **Terraform**  
- Checking risks with **Prowler**  
- Using **AI** to fix stuff fast  
- Storing logs smartly in **S3**  

---

## ✅ **What You Need**

- **AWS Free Tier** (no cost!)  
- **AWS CLI** and an admin user  
- **Terraform** (latest version)  
- **Prowler** installed  
- *Optional*: AI tools for extra smarts
