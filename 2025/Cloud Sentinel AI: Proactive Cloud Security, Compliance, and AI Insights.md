# üîê Secure AWS VPC Infrastructure with Cloud Security, Terraform, and AI-Driven Insights

## üöÄ Overview

This project demonstrates a **secure, scalable, and production-ready AWS VPC environment**, deployed first **manually** and then automated using **Terraform**. It focuses on **core cloud security principles**, including **network segmentation, IAM security, traffic flow control, and compliance checks**. The project integrates **Prowler for AWS security auditing** and **AI-based security insights** to detect and suggest remediations for potential misconfigurations.

## üõ† Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Phase 1: Manual AWS Deployment**

1. **Create VPC and Subnets**
   - Public & Private Subnets (Multi-AZ)
2. **Deploy Internet and NAT Gateways**
3. **Configure Route Tables for traffic flow**
4. **Set up Bastion Host in Public Subnet**
5. **Launch Web Servers in Private Subnets**
6. **Apply Security Groups & IAM Roles**
7. **Store EC2 logs in S3 with lifecycle policy**

---


## Challenges Faced during phase 1:

## SSH Connection Troubleshooting Summary

1. **Bastion Host Connection Failure**: Initial SSH connection to the bastion host (13.201.119.178) failed with "Connection timed out" error.

2. **Security Group Restriction**: Security group configuration was allowing SSH access only from a specific IP address (111.92.13.48/32), not from your CloudShell IP.

3. **Private Server Access**: Attempted direct connection to private web server (10.0.3.34) from CloudShell, which is not possible as private IPs are not accessible from the internet.

4. **Missing SSH Key**: When connecting from the bastion host to the private web server, the SSH key wasn't available on the bastion host.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Security Group Update**: Modified the security group to allow SSH access from your current IP address.

Update the security group to allow your current IP:

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id sg-074d14580bded3ade \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 22 \
    --cidr $(curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com)/32

This adds your current IP to the allowed list while keeping the existing rule.

2. **Two-Step SSH Connection**: Established connection to the bastion host first, then from there to the private web server.

3. **SSH Agent Forwarding**: Used SSH agent forwarding to authenticate to the private server without copying the private key to the bastion host.

eval $(ssh-agent) 
ssh-add keypair.pem 
ssh -A ec2-user@13.201.119.178


This approach followed the proper security pattern for accessing private resources in AWS, using a bastion host as the secure entry point and keeping sensitive credentials (SSH keys) protected.


### **Phase 2: Security Auditing with Prowler**

- **Run Prowler** for:
  - IAM Misconfigurations
  - Network Exposure
  - Encryption and Compliance Violations (CIS, PCI, GDPR)
- **Generate Security Report**

---

### **Phase 3: AI-Driven Security Insights**

- **Analyze Prowler output** with AI tool (custom script/ChatGPT/LLM API)
- Generate:
  - Top 10 security risks
  - AI-suggested remediation steps
  - Risk categorization: Critical, High, Medium, Low

---

### **Phase 4: Terraform Automation**

- Rebuild entire infrastructure using Terraform:
  - VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, IGW, NAT
  - EC2 instances with provisioning
  - IAM roles, S3, and Security Groups
- Outputs:
  - Terraform `.tf` files and `state` management

## ü§ñ AI Security Integration

After running **Prowler**, AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Amazon Bedrock, LangChain) analyze reports to:
- Summarize vulnerabilities
- Provide prioritized action plan
- Suggest IAM, VPC, and resource-specific improvements
- Generate human-readable security posture report
